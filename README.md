Core functionality:
- `Model`: A database wrapper class that handles sql queries
    - `UserModel`, `RatingModel`, `CommentModel` inherits the Model Class
- `Controller`: Handles user requests and passes them to the `Model` Class for database operations.
    - `UserController`, `RatingController`, `CommentController` inherits the `BaseController` class.
- `Route`: handles requests to 'user-friendly' urls to .php files located in `/routes`
